### 1. Usage
This Project is broken into one R-Markdown File and an RShiny app that is comprised of ui, server, and app files.

Project 2 - Complete Analysis: This file is a complete analysis of the data including modeling and validation. The code can be run from start to finish in sequence on a clean workspace. Path variables will need to be set before running, the test file and data to make prediction on are included in the repo. The final output of this analysis will be a file with quality predictions on an unknown dataset, as well as four machine learning models: Initial, Intermediate, Final, and Stepwise. Copies of these models are also included in the repo.

RShiny App: ui, server, and app. Error in File. Work in Progress

Included Files: 
  Wine Train Set.csv - This is the dataset used to train, test, and validate the models.
  Wine Test Set.csv - This is the dataset lacking a quality attribute to make predictions on.
  wine_submission.csv - These are the final predictions generated by my desired model.
